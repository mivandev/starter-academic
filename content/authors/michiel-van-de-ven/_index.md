I am a PhD candidate at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, pursuing my PhD in Health Technology Assessment. My thesis is about how Whole Genome Sequencing can be best implemented in oncology. I have a strong research background with expertise in applying quantitative methods, such as statistical and dynamic simulation modeling, to real-world evidence.
